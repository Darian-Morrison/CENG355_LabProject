# CENG355_LabProject

PWM Signal Generation and Monitoring System which uses an external timer (NE555 IC) to generate a signal. Uses external optocoupler
controlled by STMF0 Discovery board to control signal frequency. The Microcontroller is used to measure the frequency of the signal and resistance caused by the signal.

DESIGN APPROACH (Tenative)

1. Use Lab 1 code for frequency measurement to output values from wave generator to LCD.
2. Implement PMW Signal Generation and output frequency to LCD
3. Measure Resistance and output to LCD
